## Vanadium
Vanadium is **W.I.P (Work In Progress)**, which means that until I don't have a v0.1.0 fleshed out I will not share a lot of information about it to avoid overpromising, but here is a short overview of what I **want** Vanadium to be:
> Vanadium is a strictly typed, high-level systems programming language with strong memory management, strict semantics and C interoperability. Designed as a stricter but more modern and less painful alternative of C/C++, Vanadium provides raw power and performance with explicitness and transparency while also implementing a rich standard library with helpers, macros and abstraction of more complex systems.
- Nykenik24, Creator of Vanadium
Remember that this is the objective and that it's what I will try to follow, but nothing is 100% promised, tho Vanadium will *probably* be like this.
