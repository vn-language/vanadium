## Vanadium
Vanadium is very **W.I.P (Work In Progress)**, only a small part is made, which means that until I don't have a v0.1.0 fleshed out I will not share a lot of information about it to avoid overpromising, but here is a short overview of what I **want** Vanadium to be:

> Vanadium is a robust programming language built with expressiveness and safety in mind. It blends low-level paradigms like manual memory management and bit-sized integers with high-level features, backed by a powerful unsafe system for when full control is needed.
>
> Vanadium gives you what you expect from C++ â€” and then some: interfaces, `defer` and memory management helpers, cleaner lambdas, simpler iteration, safer (but optional) casting, sealed classes, a real module system, compile-time values, clean error handling (`try`, `guard`, etc.), implicit type inference (without auto), and more.

Remember that this is the objective and that it's what I will try to follow, but nothing is 100% promised, tho Vanadium will *probably* be like this. BUT, if you still want to know more about design and specification of Vanadium, there is a [website](https://vn-language.github.io) for it that will contain information and maybe a small blog to follow development.

Vanadium is fully open-source and non-profit. It is currently being developed in C++.
