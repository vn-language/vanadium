## Vanadium
Vanadium is very **W.I.P (Work In Progress)**, only a small part is made, which means that until I don't have a v0.1.0 fleshed out I will not share a lot of information about it to avoid overpromising, but here is a short overview of what I **want** Vanadium to be:

> "Vanadium is a strictly typed, high-level systems programming language with strong memory management, strict semantics and C interoperability. Designed as a stricter but more modern and less painful alternative of C/C++, Vanadium provides raw power and performance with explicitness and transparency while also implementing a rich standard library with helpers, macros and abstraction of more complex systems."
- Nykenik24, Creator of Vanadium

Remember that this is the objective and that it's what I will try to follow, but nothing is 100% promised, tho Vanadium will *probably* be like this. BUT, if you still want to know more about design and specification of Vanadium, there is an [incoming website](https://vn-language.github.io) for it that will contain information and maybe a small blog to follow development.
