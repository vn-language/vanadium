## Vanadium
Vanadium is very **W.I.P (Work In Progress)**, only a small part is made, which means that until I don't have a v0.1.0 fleshed out I will not share a lot of information about it to avoid overpromising, but here is a short overview of what I **want** Vanadium to be:

> Vanadium is a robust systems-level programming language built with expressiveness, safety and strictness in mind. It combines systems-level features, like manual memory management or bit-sized integers, with high-level features, like lambdas or a file-based module system. 
> 
> Vanadium is often thought of as the safer, more expressive version of C++.
> 
> Some of its core features are:
> - C interoperability
> - Blocks as expressions
> - Strong typing and weak casts
> - Low overhead *(if you don't mess up a lot)*
> - JIT-compilation
> - Clean error handling
> - Intuitive module system
> - Simple iterators <small>*(yes, [that exists](https://preview.redd.it/just-do-for-loops-why-do-you-gotta-complicate-things-so-much-v0-ha3h3fd7a4ue1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=64d0a896b143714a2db035a598a232462707238b))*</small>
> - Sealed classes
> - Lambdas

Remember that this is the objective and that it's what I will try to follow, but nothing is 100% promised, tho Vanadium will *probably* be like this. BUT, if you still want to know more about design and specification of Vanadium, there is a [website](https://vn-language.github.io) for it that will contain information and maybe a small blog to follow development.

Vanadium is fully open-source and non-profit. It is currently being developed in C++.
